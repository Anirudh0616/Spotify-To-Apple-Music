# Spotify-To-Apple-Music
Ever wanted to sync your spotify library to your apple music library, hassle free? 
---
# Instructions
+ Change the Spotify ID's in the main.py and the Apple music team ids that you can get from their respective developer portals by logging into your account. They are pretty easy to find with google searches.
+ Make sure you have Spotipy and jwt installed using pip .
  `pip install spotipy`
  `pip install jwt`

> Apparently Apple Music API, where you get the team ID from is now behind a payment wall (about $99 per year)... Unless you are willing to pay , which I don't see the value in or you have access to the developer account ,its gonna be hard to do.
