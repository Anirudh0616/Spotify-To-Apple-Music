# Spotify-To-Apple-Music
## Ever wanted to sync your spotify library to your apple music library, hassle free? 

# Instructions
+ Make a Spotify app in their [developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/) and add the URI from the code to the URI redirects in the dashboard.
+ Change the Spotify ID's in the main.py and the Apple music team ids that you can get from their respective developer portals by logging into your account. They are pretty easy to find with google searches.
+ Make sure you have Spotipy, requests and jwt installed using pip . <br>
  `pip install spotipy`
  `pip install requests`
  `pip install jwt`

> Apparently Apple Music API, where you get the team ID from is now behind a payment wall (about $99 per year)... Unless you are willing to pay , which I don't see the value in or you have access to the developer account ,its gonna be hard to do. You might be able to use the developer account of a friend , beacause it takes the music token from the user which is accessible from an Apple device.
